# LinkedList-Matrix

Wrote code that allows you to pass in matrices to perform one of four operations
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Addition
- Transpose
- Scalar Multiplication

The matrices are limited to square matrices, but when passing in a matrix there is no need to specify 0 values, and the matrix data structure implemented in the code does not store 0 values in memory, saving space.
